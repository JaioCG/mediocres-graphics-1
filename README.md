#  Mediocres Graphics

On-screen graphics used for [Mediocres](https://twitch.tv/mediocresevents) speedrunning events. Will be updated as events progress and new layouts/features get added.

The code is terrible, so you probably don't want to use this, however this repository's purpose is to be a reference for basic-level NodeCG work for speedrunning marathons.
